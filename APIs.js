// API: Application Programming Interface
// It is how we interact with a program using code. When the program runs on an external server,
// we interact with it through HTTP requests, sent via the internet.

// For applications running on a server, the API is the definition of what HTTP requests the server will respond to, and the format of the response it will send back.

// The term "API" refers to any external server that can be ineracted with through HTTP requests -- When we create these HTTP
// requests, we are " calling an API".

// Ex: to interact with the Github API to do a GET request of a repo, we need the command-line tool "curl" + URL -->
// curl https://api.github.com/repos/evanw/esbuild
